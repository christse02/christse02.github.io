          <hr>
          <p>Hey there, I'm Christine, a Chinese-Jamaican currently living in Hong Kong, studying computer science at the Hong Kong Univeristy of Science and Technology. <br>
              I have been living in Hong Kong for about four years since deciding to move here for my university studies, after completeing my highschool diploma and associate's degree in Jamaica.<br>
              <br>
              My parents are originally from Hong Kong but raised our family in Jamaica, so I was eager to move to Hong Kong to get to know this side of my culture better, and have even started to learn Cantonese. Since living in such a diverse community, I have a lot more appreciation for my own, and also other cultures. <br>

              <i>Facade</i> is an <b>adaptive emotion-driven</b> computer game, which challenges the player to decipher what is <b>reality and illusion</b>.<br><br>
              The game is set as dialogue-based interrogation game, where the player is asked questions regarding an event that they have no background knowledge on. The aim of the game is to be as consistent and convincing as possible so as to not induce suspicion in the emotionally-intelligent detectives.<br><br>
              Our game uses two kinds of player input: <b>mouse-and-key-clicks</b> and also <b>emotional state</b>. We developed a <b>facial expression recognition</b> (FER) model which runs in realtime to predict the player's emotional state. <br><br>
              For a video of the playthrough of the demo-portion of game, check below in <a href= "index.html#portfolio">Project Portfolio.</a><br><br>

            A dialogue system that take user’s utterances to complete the task of restaurant reservations. <br>The system assists users in booking reservations at a restaurant, and achieves this goal in five steps: process the user’s request and issue an API call, allow for modification of the request, display all relevant restaurant options from which the user can select the restaurant of their preference, provide additional details of the selected restaurant – all in a conversational dialogue format. <br><br>
            The system is built as an end-to-end learning dialogue system built as a hybrid code network (HCN), trained initially using supervised learning and then optimized using reiforcement learning methods. <br>
